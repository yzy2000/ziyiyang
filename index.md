### Data Analytics 

#### [Predict Opioid Overdose Events in Cincinnati](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yzy2000/yzy2000/blob/master/_layouts/final.html) 

Using Geospatial Risk Prediction Model, it can help the local government especially for Cincinnati Fire Department to allocate their resources more efficiently. By analyzing the actual overdose location and risk factors, CFD staff can have a sense about which areas/quarter mile within a engine have a higher density of overdose cases that might need to more services and interventions in that area or equipping officers with the opioid overdose antidote naloxone. Additional focus on overdose-incidence areas and funding extensive community outreach efforts to educate individuals on how to recognize opioid overdoses and take immediate life-saving measures.

#### [Hddonic Home Price Prediction](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yzy2000/yzy2000/blob/master/_layouts/ANOVA.html)

In this project, we aim to build a better home price forecasting model for Boulder County in order to maintain Zillow’s advantage in the local real estate market. However, due to the volatility and complexity of the real estate market, this is a challenging and difficult task. We apply the traditional hedonic model to predict house prices, which takes into account internal features, amenities and spatial structure. This was achieved using an OLS (Ordinary least square) regression model, which essentially quantifies the impact of each component of the model on house prices and ultimately predicts house prices.

#### [Predict bike share trips in Washington,D.C.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yzy2000/yzy2000/blob/master/_layouts/Ziyi-Yang-assignment-5.html)

This project will take Washington DC as the research area and include key features like time of day, day of the week, location, distance, weather, altitude into the model, forecast space/time demand for bike share pickups. We can see when the demand for bicycles may cause the stations to run out, and then remove the excess bicycles from other places. Therefore, the compancy can reasonably predict demand and allocate bicycles in advance.

#### [People Based Machine Learning– Emil City Home Repair Tax Credit Program](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yzy2000/yzy2000/blob/master/_layouts/Ziyi%20Yang%20Assignment%204.html)

Emil City is considering a more proactive approach for targeting home owners who qualify for a home repair tax credit program. This tax credit program has been around for close to twenty years, the uptake of the credit is woefully inadequate. The consensus at HCD is that the low conversion rate is due to the fact that the agency reaches out to eligible homeowners at random. To move toward a more targeted campaign, convert all the client-level data collected from previous campaigns into a decision-making analytic that can better target their limited outreach resources. The purpose of this project is to train the best classifier I can and use the results to inform a cost-benefit analysis.

#### [Risk Modeling - Predictive Policing](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yzy2000/yzy2000/blob/master/_layouts/Assignment3-Ziyi.html)

A geospatial risk prediction model borrows the weapon violation experience in places where it has been observed, and tests whether that experience generalizes to places where its risk may be high, despite few actual events. If these tests are true, the resulting predictions can be considered a “potential risk” of weapon violations and can be used to distribute police responses across spaces. In this project, predicting weapon violation as a function of environmental factors and validate the model against a kernel density.

### RESEARCH PAPER

- [Spatiotemporal patterns and modifiable areal unit problems of the landscape ecological risk in coastal areas: A case study of the Shandong Peninsula, China](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7377767) published on Journal of Cleaner Production 2021 v.310

Ecological risk assessment is the basis for sustainable land use and ecological protection and management in coastal areas. The research scale of ecological risk assessment is usually determined by empirical methods, and existing research focused on coastal areas is relatively limited. This paper aims to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of ecological risk in coastal areas, taking the Shandong Peninsula as the study area, and to determine the optimal scale of ecological risk assessment based on semivariogram analysis.
